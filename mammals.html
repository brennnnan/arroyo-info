				<h3>Coyote</h3>
				<h5>Canis latrans</h5>
				<p>Coyotes are found all over North America and are close relatives to the Gray Wolf and Red Wolf. Unlike their wolf cousins coyotes are relatively small, with a very negative public opinion of them. Coyotes are often thought to be untrustworthy, evil animals. However, they play an important role in regulating the population of squirrels.  </p>

				<h3>Audobon Cottontail</h3>
				<h5>Sylvilagus audobonii</h5>
				<p>Also known as the "Desert Cottontail", this rabbit is found throughout the Eastern US as well as Northern Mexico. Though it is smaller than European Rabbits, this species has much larger ears and is much more social. It can run up to 20mph - unfortunately, almost every carnivorous thing faster than it is its predator.</p>
