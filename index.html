			<h2>What this is</h2>
			<div class="text-container">
				<p>This is a website set up by the arroyo seco protection agency in response to growing concern that the arroyo is disappearing. This web page serves as a test run and information destination for those wishing to learn more about the native animals around the arroyo, as well as learn how to be better stewards of the environment. We believe that teaching children the value and intriguing aspects of nature will help them to better protect the Earth when they are eventually the last ones alive to be its stewards because of the unfortunate alien takeover that is likely to ensure one ticketmaster becomes the sole ticketing agency.</p>

			<h2>Who we are</h2>
			<div class="text-container">
				<p>We are an agency dedicated to the proliferation of propaganda supporting the boring, lifeless plants and animals that natively inhabit the area in southern california known as the arroyo seco. We rally behind the natives because we feel bad for moving into their land and displacing them. We are supported by various local and state government funds, as well as by generous donations from the public. We are still working on our first project, but are looking forward to the opening day of our new arroyo themed merry-go-round!</p>
