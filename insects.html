				<p>Honestly, insects are kind of annoying. I'm not saying i have anything specifically against them, but with all their buzzing and stinging they can be a bee in your bonnet. However, insects make up the backbone of the arroyo ecosystem. They act as pollinators for almost everything that grows here, allowing us to keep the lovely plants around us alive and reproducing. Of course there are some downsides like stings, allergic reactions, and more - but it is important for us to look past these aspects when making policy decisions regarding pesticides and their effect on potential pollinators.</p>
