				<p>Reptiles are a perfect match for southern Californias excessively sunny climate. Because they are cold blooded, they depend on the warth of the sun to give them the energy they need to look for food, make a home, and potentially escape from predators. Reptiles are plentiful in the arroyo, especially lizards. There are many kind of lizards in the arroyo, including blue belly's, alligator lizards, and skinks. Reptiles are also great because they eat mosquitos before they can infect us with west nile virus. </p>
